## Project Description
This project aims to classify cat vocalizations using machine learning. Audio features (MFCCs) are extracted from cat meow audio files to train and evaluate regression models, including linear and ridge regression. The pipeline includes:
- Data collection and pre-processing
- Feature extraction (MFCC)
- Exploratory data analysis
- Model development and evaluation
- Testing and validation

## Software & Tools
- Python 3.9+
- Libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow / PyTorch, Librosa
- IDE: VS Code / Jupyter Notebook
- Dataset: Kaggle (Cat Meow Classification)
